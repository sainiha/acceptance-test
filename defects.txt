These defects are based on my understanding of the requirements and checking the data in glasgow.json file

1) rounding off is not proper, it is trimmed while displaying. 13.57 should be 14 but trimmed to 13
2) pressure was not in requirements but displayed in UI
3) time is ahead in UI by 1 hr, for e.g in JSON it is 09:00 but in UI it is 10:00
4) wind direction for friday heading is 171 degree but icon is not correctly displayed in UI, I guess for angles between 0-180 its not displayed correctly in UI
5) cannot differentiate with the icon whether it is a light rain or heavy rain but is specified in JSON
6) requirements say enter city name but could not find a box/place to enter
7) I am not sure what is most dominant condition. My understanding is that it is the value which is occuring the most.
    7a) based on above, the rain icon is not correctly displayed. for e.g. for wednesday mostly it is raining but in top cloudy is displayed.
    I guess current condition is displayed for the cloud icon.
    7b) Same goes for wind

Accessibility defects
1) Application is not keyboard accessible

2) Skip to content is not present. For e.g. there are 5 different breadcrumbs, links, adverts etc on the page.
Skip to content in html is put in order so that the user can go directly to main content
for e.g.
<div id="skiplink-container">
<div>
<a class="skiplink" href="#content">Skip to main content</a>
</div>
<div>Some cookie message , etc</div>
</div>
<main id="content" role="main">
<div id="....

3) aria-expendables are not used. With rich javascript applications which has collapsible and expandable fields as in this application it is
advisable to use aria-expanded=true/false, aria-hidden=true/false. These aria elements are industry standard and automatically recognised by
speech recognition software
